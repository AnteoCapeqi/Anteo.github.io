If none of these themes fit within your taste, it's quite easy to customize and create your own too. 

## GitHub Pages

GitHub makes it easy to create personal websites. Follow this link - [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to know how or follow the steps below.

If you already have a GitHub profile (obviously)

* Create a new repo with the name `{username}.github.io`
* Clone/Fork this repo and copy the files to your newly created repo
* Customize your name, links and everything else for your landing page
* `git push`

Voila! Your site should be live at `https://{username}.github.io`
